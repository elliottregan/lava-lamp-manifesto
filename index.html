                <h1>From the Manifesto Concerning the Lava Lamp</h1>

                <p>
                    A specter is haunting the office—the specter of hot-desking.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The history of all hitherto existing workplaces is the
                    history of class struggles between those who own the desks
                    and those who must wander.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The executive class, in its relentless pursuit of
                    "productivity metrics" and "collaboration synergies," has
                    stripped the worker of the most basic dignity: a permanent
                    station at which to labor. Where once the proletarian worker
                    possessed a desk—modest though it was, adorned perhaps with
                    a lava lamp of sentimental value—now they possess nothing.
                    The contractor, that most precarious member of the laboring
                    class, becomes a nomad, forced to alight upon whatever
                    surface the management class has deemed "available."
                </p>

                <p>
                    But let us trace the chain of exploitation that led to the
                    Great Lava Lamp Catastrophe:
                </p>

                <p>
                    The executive class, ensconced in their private offices with
                    doors that close, decreed: "Return to the workplace!" Yet
                    they provided no additional desks. This is no accident. This
                    is the logic of capital—to extract maximum value while
                    minimizing investment in the material conditions of labor.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The contractor, denied a workspace of his own, was compelled
                    by the objective conditions of his employment to sit at the
                    desk of another worker. He did not choose this. The modes of
                    production chose it for him.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The lava lamp, an innocent ornament of the worker's
                    alienated existence—a small bubble of liquid comfort in the
                    cold fluorescent wasteland—became the inevitable casualty of
                    this systemic contradiction.
                </p>

                <h2>Who, then, is truly responsible?</h2>

                <p>
                    Not the contractor, whose hand merely executed what the
                    system demanded. No—the hand that knocked over the lamp was
                    merely the instrument. The true agent of destruction sits in
                    the C-suite, wielding policies like weapons against the
                    working conditions of the masses.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The executive will say: "But we need people in the office
                    for culture!" All the while, they have created a culture of
                    scarcity, musical chairs, and broken lava lamps.
                </p>

                <p class="closing">
                    The time has come to seize the means of desk-ownership.
                    True ownership of our labor begins with ownership of where we labor.
